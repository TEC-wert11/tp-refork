# API Documentation
## Personal Health Routine Tracker (Desktop App, Non-Medical)

This document describes the internal APIs exposed between the main modules of the Personal Health Routine Tracker desktop application. Although the system is not a web service, it still uses clear internal module boundaries so that the UI, parser, services, repositories, and export logic remain maintainable and testable.

- **Scope:** Internal module APIs only (not public network APIs).
- **Product type:** Desktop application with strict command-based input; no LLM or natural language inference.
- **Roles:** Patient (data entry) and Caregiver (view-only summaries and logs).

## 1. Core Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| CommandController | Receives raw command text from the patient UI and routes it to the right service. |
| CommandParser | Validates syntax and converts strict commands into structured command objects. |
| RoutineService | Handles record/skip/list logic for fixed daily tasks such as meals and medications. |
| DeadlineService | Creates and retrieves one-off deadlines with flexible time parsing. |
| ExerciseService | Stores daily exercise entries. |
| SymptomService | Stores symptom description with severity from 1-10. |
| DailyNoteService | Stores freeform special notes for the day. |
| ListService | Builds the today view containing fixed tasks and deadlines. |

## 5. Validation Rules

- Only the strict command set is accepted. Commands outside the grammar return a parser error.
- Symptom severity must be an integer from 1-10.
- Only five fixed routine items are supported: `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, `medication1`, `medication2`.
- The `record` command overwrites the previous same-day status for the same fixed item.
- The caregiver role is read-only and cannot call write methods through the UI controller.
- Deadline parsing should normalize several common time formats into one internal `LocalDateTime` format.
