# Healthcare Everyday

Some days, care is not one big decision. It is ten small ones: medicine on time, enough water, a short walk, and a quick note on how the day felt.

Healthcare Everyday is an offline-first JavaFX desktop app for seniors and caregivers to keep those small decisions visible and manageable: daily and weekly routines, daily logs, history review, and summary reports, all stored locally on the same machine.

> This app is for routine tracking and record-keeping only. It does not provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice.

## User stories

- As a senior, I want to see today’s daily and weekly routines and mark them done, so I do not forget important habits.
- As a senior, I want to write a short daily log, so wellbeing patterns can be reviewed later.
- As a caregiver, I want to add, edit, or remove routines for each senior, so task lists stay aligned with care needs.
- As a caregiver, I want to view history and generate a summary report, so I can review progress and share updates clearly.
- As a user, I want records stored locally on this machine, so data remains available across sessions.
